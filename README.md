My name is Jeremy Louie, and I am a fourth-year undergraduate studying Mathematics of Computation student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). 

I’ve always had a strong interest in extending the academia I learned beyond the classroom. That’s why I’ve engaged in projects such as examining the accuracy in estimating two ordinary differential equations using the Range Kutta Method.

Programming has also given rise to my hobby as a barista. In fact, you can find me making up coffee and tea concoctions on the weekends. Beyond that, I’m also passionate in photography – a hobby I hope to make into a side career as a professional.

Above all, I’m always willing to keep up with the rapidly changing pace of technology by learning something new everyday
