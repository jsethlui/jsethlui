🐻 My name is Jeremy Louie, and I am a fourth-year undergraduate studying Mathematics of Computation student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). 

🧑🏻‍💻 I’ve always had a strong interest in extending the academia I learned beyond the classroom. That’s why I’ve engaged in projects such as examining the accuracy in estimating two ordinary differential equations using the Range Kutta Method.

☕️ Programming has also given rise to my hobby as a barista. In fact, you can find me making up coffee and tea concoctions on the weekends. Beyond that, I’m also passionate in photography – a hobby I hope to make into a side career as a professional.

📱 Above all, I’m always willing to keep up with the rapidly changing pace of technology by learning something new everyday
